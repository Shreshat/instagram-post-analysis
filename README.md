I've dedicated considerable time to researching Instagram reach, diligently collecting data on post performance after a week.
This practice has provided valuable insights into the workings of Instagram's algorithm. 
Analyzing your Instagram account's reach entails manual data collection, as existing APIs often prove unreliable. 
Therefore, manual data collection remains the preferred method.
If you're a data science student eager to delve into Instagram reach analysis using Python, you can utilize the dataset I've compiled from my Instagram account.
